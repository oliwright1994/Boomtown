# Boomtown - Server

For this project we used Apollo, Express and Graphql to initiate an Apollo app that would allow us to query a databse using GraphQL

## Technologies used:

- Apollo Server
- GraphQL
- GraphQL Playground
- npm
- Express

## Personal Learnings:

- How to create an instance of an Apollo app and how to provide it context, as well as assigning it enviroment variables.

- How to link GraphQl queries to their correct resolvers, and how to provide;
  • The SQL code needed for the functions
  • How to provide SQL with values from JS to make them dynamic

- How the GraphQL schema dictates the form and input or query must take.

- How to use the try and catch clauses to handle errors correctly, without crashing you program.

- How to go about refactoring completely baffling code.
